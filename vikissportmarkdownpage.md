 ## History of BOP Academy
At the New Zealand Cricket Annual General Meeting held on the 11 November 1931 the affiliation of Bay of Plenty Cricket was confirmed. The 1930/31 Season Annual Report noted that the “number of affiliated associations increased to 23 with the addition of Bay of Plenty”. 

One of the best players to represent Bay of Plenty in the thirties was Lester Spring who arrived in Whakatane during July 1938. Spring was in the top draw of first class players in the country, representing Manawatu from 1926 to 1931, during which time Manawatu participated in 13 Hawke Cup games. 

On the 26 February 1930 in a Hawke Cup game between Manawatu and Southland Lester smashed a 106 runs – and set a 10th wicket partnership record with Maurice O’Keefe who contributed 62 runs. 

Lester played cricket in Canterbury for a two seasons before transferring to Auckland in December 1933. Just before departure from Christchurch he was selected for Christchurch Town to play Country, which was essentially a Canterbury trial. In the town side Lester played alongside one of the real legends of New Zealand cricket in Walter Hadlee. 

On 14 December 1936 Lester was selected in the all-conquering Auckland Plunkett Shield team. After playing Canterbury at Christmas the a media report said “Spring has a excellent chance to represent New Zealand to tour England in March 1937 under TC Lowry, in company with certainties HG Vivian, PE Whitlaw, W Cowie, M Wallace and WN Carson all of Auckland”. 

A shoulder blade injury resulted in the talented batsman remaining at home. In July 1938 Lester arrived in Whakatane after purchasing a local accountancy firm. Joining the Whakatane United Cricket Club (which is still alive and well) the new recruit went on a batting and bowling blitz. During the 1938/39 season he smashed 706 runs with a highest score of 148 (including 9 sixes) and took 67 wickets with the ball. 

Bay of Plenty representation came quickly, with selection to captain the Bay against Waikato in a Hawke Cup challenge on the 31st December 1938. Captaincy again followed against Sir Julian Cahn’s English touring side in Rotorua. 

Another Hawke Cup game came in March 1940 when the Bay were well beaten by Manawatu. At nearly forty years of age Lester again took the skippers role against Waikato on 1st January 1 1948 in a Hawke Cup challenge, and played against the Fijian tourists the same season – scoring 48 runs out of the Bay of Plenty total of 148. 

It is worth noting that in the 1947/48 season when Whakatane United won the Williams Cup, they were so strong in the Eastern Bay of Plenty, that they had to withdraw from the local competition, and played against teams in Gisborne and the Waikato. The team, which was captained by NE Rigden, played 18 games in which they compiled some 4228 runs with 2887 runs scored against them. 

While club cricket was alive and well in the Bay of Plenty in the 1930’s – Research for this publication suggests that there were two Bay of Plenty Association, with the Bay of Plenty Sub-Association based in the Eastern Bay of Plenty, affiliating to New Zealand Cricket in the 1930/31 season. 

In the same period of the early 1930s, representative cricket was also played by teams from the Rotorua and Tauranga Cricket Associations. 

In February 1931 the following players were selected for a Bay of Plenty team to play their Rotorua counter parts. Lee, Kenny, Young (Matata) Menzies, HA Wardlaw, Wells (Waimana) GC Peebles, JD Wardlaw, Coney, Spoors (Whakatane) Dare (Te Puke) Emergencies: Darvell, FJ Burt. 

In the 1931/32 season a match between Bay of Plenty and Rotorua, appeared to become a selection trial for a Bay of Plenty team from the two regions, to challenge South Auckland for the Hawke Cup.
